# README.md

## Overview
I have had to fork away (not from) the original project.  For some reason the github repo does not have artifacts matching what is available at BKcore' web page.  So, I used wget to pull down the content from:  
http://hexgl.bkcore.com/play/ 
specifically the following files in to the location below:  
bkcore/hexgl/HexGL.js  
bkcore/hexgl/ShipControls.js

## Deploy on OpenShift
```
## HexGL
### Create Your Project and Deploy App (HexGL)
```
# HexGL is a HTML5 video game resembling WipeOut from back in the day (Hack the Planet!)
MYPROJ="hexgl"
oc new-project $MYPROJ --description="HexGL Video Game" --display-name="HexGL Game" || { echo "ERROR: something went wrong"; sleep 5; exit 9; }
oc new-app php:7.3~https://github.com/cloudxabide/HexGL.git --image-stream="openshift/php:latest" --strategy=source

# Wait for the build to complete (CrashLoopBackoff is "normal" for this build)
oc get pods -w

# Add a route (hexgl.linuxrevolution.com)
echo '{ "kind": "List", "apiVersion": "v1", "metadata": {}, "items": [ { "kind": "Route", "apiVersion": "v1", "metadata": { "name": "hexgl", "creationTimestamp": null, "labels": { "app": "hexgl" } }, "spec": { "host": "hexgl.linuxrevolution.com", "to": { "kind": "Service", "name": "hexgl" }, "port": { "targetPort": 8080 }, "tls": { "termination": "edge" } }, "status": {} } ] }' | oc create -f -

# Add a route (hexgl.apps.ocp4-mwn.linuxrevolution.com)
#echo '{ "kind": "List", "apiVersion": "v1", "metadata": {}, "items": [ { "kind": "Route", "apiVersion": "v1", "metadata": { "name": "hexgl", "creationTimestamp": null, "labels": { "app": "hexgl" } }, "spec": { "host": "hexgl.apps.ocp4-mwn.linuxrevolution.com", "to": { "kind": "Service", "name": "hexgl" }, "port": { "targetPort": 8080 }, "tls": { "termination": "edge" } }, "status": {} } ] }' | oc create -f -

# Once the app is built (and running) update the deployment
oc scale deployment.apps/php --replicas=0
oc scale deployment.apps/hexgl --replicas=3

-- Or...
oc edit deployment.apps/php
spec:
  replicas: 0
```

At some point you will be able to browse to (depending on the route you enabled):
https://hexgl.linuxrevolution.com/
```
